# State Management and Store - Mobx Vs Redux Vs State and Props
Small application handled by State and Props. No Mobx and no Redux.

# Unit Tests
```javascript
yarn test
```
Unit tests have been setup and some have been added, though better covered is needed.

## Notes and TODO:
 * The code as reduced comments, this was a choice to allow (hopefully) code readability.
 * There is also Travis-CI integration.
 * Search on 'Title of Movie'.
 * Fix Unit Test fail.
 * Need to add an app icon.
 * More Unit Tests
